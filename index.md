# What is this?

I created this site to transition a number of pentesting cheat sheets
that I have slowly been assembling from my computer into the
internet. Mainly to improve accessibility and ensure they are
backed-up. Anyone is welcome to use them, however they are intended
for personal use so might not be well documented :wink:

## And Also

From time to time, I will also publish items that interest me. For
example, while I don't intend to regularly post full walkthroughs of
hacking challenge boxes (as others do much better job than myself),
there are times where I find unique (or at least not well documented)
routes that I will publish here as excerpts of the boxes.
